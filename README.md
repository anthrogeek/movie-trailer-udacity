# Movie Trailer Website: Fresh Tomatoes

This is my submission for **Project P1: Movie Trailer Website**, part of Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004).

### About
The project details are:

> Write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.


### How to run

You need to have Python 2.7 installed on your machine.
To run the script, clone this repository directory and run `entertainment_center.py`.  
It will dynamically create `fresh_tomatoes.html` page for you to view.
